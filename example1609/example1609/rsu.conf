# NOTES FOR IPv6 PROVISION:
# The prefix, prefix length and default gateway for the IPv6 service is
# broadcast in the WSA. This prefix comes from the global address assigned
# to the wave-data interface.
# Each service below may optionally have a specific IPv6 host address
# associated with the service (these are included in the service info parts
# of the WSA, see the IEEE 1609.3 standard for details).
# If a prefix other than the prefix of the global address on wave-data is
# desired to be advertised, then the 'override' prefix settings can be used,
# which are included further below.
# The default gateway address advertised in the WSA will be either the global
# or the link-local address of wave-data interface, this can be configured
# further below (by default it is the link-local address).
# The default configuration provided below provides IPv6 service on SCH.
# To set the IPv6 prefix to be advertised, you must assign a global address
# to wave-data interface before running the RSE application, or you must
# set the WSA prefix override in the configuration below, otherwise the prefix
# advertised in the WSA will be a blank non-usable IPv6 address (::).

##### WBSS Services Configuration #####
# Up to 32 services can be configured. If 0 services are configured
# (by configuring PSIDs to 0x0ff) then there is no WBSS (WBSS is disabled).
# Note: WBSS = WAVE Basic Service Set
#       WSA = WAVE Service Announcement

WBSS_Service_Mode = 1; 0, 1
# Select the service mode for IEEE 1609.3 WAVE Basic Service Set
# 0 = user mode, 1 = provider mode, default: user

# If WBSS_Service_Mode = 0 (user) then this unit will attempt to join a provider
# which offers the services with PSIDs set below (PSID 0x0ff services excluded).
# If WBSS_Service_Mode = 1 (provider) then this unit will provide and advertise
# the services with PSIDs and other attributes set below. (PSID 0x0ff = blank).
# WSA packets are transmitted by provider on CCH to advertise services.
# WSA packets are listened for by user on CCH; user may choose to join services.

# WBSS_Service_X_IPService
#   0 = non-IP service, 1 = IP service
#   Enable this if that service provides or uses internet protocol (IP).

# WBSS_Service_X_IPAddress
#   If this service has a particular IP address associated with this particular
#   service, then enter the IPv6 address string here, otherwise leave blank.

# WBSS_Service_X_IPPort
#   If a certain IP port is associated with this particular service, then enter
#   the port number (0 to 65535), otherwise leave at 0.

# WBSS_Service_X_ChanId
#   Specify on which logical channel is the service provided: CCH, SCH or LCH
#   CCH = control channel, SCH = service channel, LCH = dedicated safety channel

# WBSS_Service_X_Prio
#   Specify the priority level of the service (0 to 31). This is a setting used
#   in User mode to determine which services are more important than others.
#   It is used in the default/stock WBSS service joining algorithm - a provider
#   which provides a higher-priority service will be joined in preference to a
#   provider which only provides a lower-priority service.
#   Priority level is from 0 to 31, 0 is lowest and 31 is highest.

# WBSS_Service_X_PSID
#   The Provider Service Identifier of this service.
#   PSID is specified in hexadecimal as the p-encoded value, length 1 to 4 bytes
#   Examples: 0x0ff      --> "OFF" (special value to indicate no service)
#             0x7f       --> testing
#             0xeffffffe --> IPv6 routing
#             0x8003     --> traveller information and roadside signage

# WBSS_Service_X_PSC
#   Provider Service Context, a string to identify the service.
#   The PSC provides supplementary information related to the service.
#   Commonly this is an identifying string, e.g. "IPv6"
#   Blank = PSC not present, if not blank then permissible lengths
#   are from 1 to 31 characters.
#   Note: "WBSS_Service_*_PSC" strings can be either plaintext or escaped hex
#   e.g. "WBSS_Service_0_PSC = IPv6" or "WBSS_Service_0_PSC = \x49\x50\x76\x36"

# WBSS_Service_X_RCPIThr
#   If present, the RCPI Threshold indicates the recommended minimum received
#   WSA signal value in dBm, 0 to â€“110, below which the application-service
#   opportunity should be ignored by a recipient. It has a length of one octet,
#   encoded as RCPI in IEEE Std 802.11. Note that this is for purposes of
#   advertisement in WSA as a recommendation, and the user is not required
#   to obey the recommendation.
#   0 = -110 dBm, 220 = 0 dBm, 255 = not present / unavailable

# WBSS_Service_X_WSACntThr
#   If present, the WSA Count Threshold indicates the recommended minimum
#   number of received WSAs, below which an application-service opportunity
#   should be ignored by a recipient. Note that this is for purposes of
#   advertisement in WSA as a recommendation, and the user is not required
#   to obey the recommendation.
#   1-255 = valid count, 0 = not present / unavailable

# WBSS_Service_X_WSACntThrI
#   WSA Count Threshold Interval: optionally used with the WSA Count Threshold,
#   it indicates the time interval over which received WSAs are counted. It has
#   a length of one octet and is an unsigned integer with range 1 to 255 in
#   units of 100 ms.
#   1-255 = valid time period [100ms units], 0 = not present / unavailable

# WBSS_Service_X_ProvMAC
#   The Provider MAC Address is a 48-bit MAC address used to address the device
#   providing the application-service. The Provider MAC Address should be set
#   if different from the MAC address of the device transmitting the WSA. If
#   set to all zero (00:00:00:00:00:00) then the provider MAC address is the
#   same as the device transmitting the WSA, otherwise the provider MAC address
#   is set as per this configuration setting.
